#  Headphones Landing Page Implementation

## Project Overview
This project involves implementing a full, responsive landing page for a fictional headphone company from scratch, based solely on a provided Figma design file. The goal is to apply all learned knowledge in HTML, CSS, Accessibility, and Responsive Design without relying on external CSS frameworks like Bootstrap.

The implementation is structured into multiple tasks, building the webpage section by section.

##  Technology Stack
* **HTML5:** Used for semantic structure and content organization.
* **CSS3:** Used for all styling, layout, responsiveness, and animations.
* **JavaScript:** Used exclusively in the final task (Task 8) to implement the interactive hamburger menu toggle for mobile views.
* **Figma:** The source of truth for all design specifications, spacing, colors, and typography.

##  Key Design and Implementation Requirements

| Requirement | Value / Implementation | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Max Content Width** | 1000px | Content must be centered within the page. |
| **Responsiveness** | Mobile version triggered at screen width **480px or less** (`@media (max-width: 480px)`). | Mobile navigation uses a hamburger menu (Task 8). |
| **Links Hover/Active Color** | `#FF6565` | Applied to all navigation and text links. |
| **Button Hover/Active** | `opacity: 0.9` | Applied to primary Call-to-Action buttons. |
| **Fonts** | **Source Sans Pro** and **Spin Cycle OT** | Fonts must be embedded or locally installed to ensure design fidelity. |
| **CSS Methodology** | Emphasis on **generic selectors**, **CSS Reset**, and use of **CSS Variables** for maintainability. |
| **Constraints** | No external CSS frameworks allowed. No JavaScript allowed until **Task 8**. |
