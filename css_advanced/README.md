# 0x05. CSS Advanced: Holberton Smiling School Webpage

This project is the CSS implementation phase for the **Holberton Smiling School** marketing webpage. Building upon the semantic HTML structure developed in the previous project, this stage focuses on using advanced CSS techniques to match the provided designer's file (Figma) and ensure the page is responsive and visually appealing across all device sizes.

##  Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to apply CSS styling to the existing `index.html` file to achieve a pixel-perfect match with the provided Figma design, covering aspects such as:

* **Global Styles:** Setting up CSS variables, font definitions, and a CSS reset (or normalization).
* **Layout:** Using Flexbox and/or CSS Grid to create complex, multi-column layouts, especially for the hero section, video list, and FAQ.
* **Responsiveness:** Implementing a mobile-first approach and using media queries to ensure the design adapts seamlessly to mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports.
* **Typography:** Correctly implementing the `Source Sans Pro` and `Spin Cycle OT` fonts and adjusting font sizes, weights, and line heights.
* **Visuals:** Applying colors, background images, subtle shadows, and ensuring all images are correctly sized and positioned.
* **Component Styling:** Styling all components, including the navigation bar, buttons, video cards, membership features, and the footer.
